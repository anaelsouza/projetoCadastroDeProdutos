# projetoCadastroDeProdutos

Here's another JS project in practice, in this one a little more of each language was worked on, HTML, CSS, JS.
The part that contains JavaScript, we work with a product registration structure, being able to add the product, list and if you want to delete the product, it is possible. It was quite complex for a "beginner" in the area, likewise something very challenging and that makes me want to learn to develop in JS more and more.
